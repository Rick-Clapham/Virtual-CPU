void execute(uint16_t instruction, uint16_t type, void *memptr)

Function designed to execute the commands given

@param instruction - Receives the current instruction

@param type - Receives and determines the type of instruction

@param memptr - Receives the Virtual CPU's buffer


void fetch(void *memptr)
Function designed to fetch the first command from memory 
@param memptr - Receives the Virtual CPU's buffer
